# Ethics

## Gender equality

On October of 2021, I attended the play "The King Kong Trial", which was intended to create a space for debate between students on issues of gender equality and sexual assault.
The debate was created between the students through a role-playing game, where they played the role of judges to judge the characters and their actions.

First of all, I would like to say that I learned a lot, both legally and morally. This play was an excellent way to convey a key message, and to awaken students who were not or not enough aware of gender equality issues, through concrete situations that we all have to experience as students.  But what particularly struck me was the extent to which these situations can affect anyone, even those we deal with every day. For example, the speaker totally deconstructed the image of the creepy rapist on the street. Most rapists are people who look totally ordinary, people we know. 
â€¨However, the debate seemed to me to be very polarised, with little room for nuance. The moderator suggested several times that the room should be divided into 3 zones, on the left to condemn the person, on the right to find them not guilty, and in the middle when they were undecided. In most of the situations staged by the comedians, the majority of the audience went for the conviction of the accused. Some were still undecided, but very few people said they wanted to defend the accused. These people were faced with an overwhelming majority, which was a form of pressure. You could see that the debate was quite closed, as few people questioned their ideas, either on one side or the other. You could see that because it was possible because few people moved from one area to another. Nevertheless, in my opinion this majority was really aware of the issues.  So I think the issue of gender equality is very important in the minds of students today.

To conclude, I think that this kind of drama and action is essential to raise awareness not only among students but also among the general public.
