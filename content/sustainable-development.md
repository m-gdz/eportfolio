# Sustainable Development

### Climate change

On 12 October 2021, I attended a conference of the Shift Project which took place at the N7. The aim of the conference was to make students aware of the climate issues that they will have to take into account as engineers.

The speaker introduced his talk with an apparently surprising fact: the planet is not in danger. In fact, it is human civilisation that is directly threatened by global warming, and it seems that it is right to be concerned. 

Some of the consequences are already unavoidable. The climate system has a lot of inertia, and cannot recover overnight. One of the most mind-blowing facts mentioned is that once the CO2 capacity of the planet is exceeded, it takes 10,000 years to remove the excess. We then understand that what's unavoidable is already here, and that the only thing we can control is the speed at which we are going to get there. Another interesting fact is that there is a difference of only 5 degrees between the average temperature of Toulouse and that of the Sahara, which shows how small variations in temperature can have major consequences.

In the end, we discovered through this conference how important the challenges are, and that it is our duty to do everything we can to slow down global warming.
