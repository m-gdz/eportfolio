# My internship at SES

## Acknowledgements

My thanks go first and foremost to my supervisor, Jan Outters, a senior engineer and Product Manager at SES within the product team. I can only be grateful to him for having given me the same trust as three years ago, when he assisted me during my first internship at SES. I would also like to thank Margaux Ulmer, Human Capital & Recruitment Coordinator, who allowed me to do this experience again. Finally, I would like to thank all the members of the product team, who included me perfectly and took me into consideration during their discussions and reflections.


## Introduction

For my first year internship, I was looking for a professional experience that would allow me to put to good use the programming skills that I have been learning on my own since middle school, and refined in engineering school. Having already worked at Société Européenne des Satellites (SES) during the summer of 2019, I was able to easily reapply for the same position as an application developer for SmartTV. 
SES is the world's leading provider of satellite communications services with over €2 billion in revenues. The company is based in Luxembourg, the state being one of its main shareholders.


## The assignment

My mission was to develop two applications for smart TVs. The first application consisted of an interface allowing the viewer to consult the electronic programme guide of all the satellite channels available on his TV, and to view content on demand. The second application allowed the user to see which channels available on the satellite were not present on their TV. He could also see if the number associated with the channel in the TV was identical to the official number. 

## The technical aspect.

The development of these apps was mainly based on the HbbTV technology. This is an industry standard that allows the development of applications for smart TVs from different manufacturers to be standardised. In concrete terms, all the manufacturers who are partners in this initiative must implement a series of functionalities in their TVs that allow the developer to use the same code base everywhere. From the developer's point of view, this standard allows in practice the development of cross-platform applications using web technologies. This opens up access to a whole range of tools and frameworks allowing developers to design and deploy their applications more quickly.

I was therefore able to develop my applications using the Svelte front-end framework and the NodeJS platform, which are two free and open-source software applications that are very widespread in the world of web development.

The difficulty of developing these applications lay in the optimization. Indeed, as the TVs are globally not performing as well as a web browser on a recent computer, I had to design the application with performance and optimization in mind, so that it would be as smooth and pleasant to use as possible. Navigating the interface was a big challenge, as it required a lot of coordination between the front-end animations and the back-end requests so that all this machinery would go unnoticed by the user. 
Indeed, these applications had to constantly make requests to a remote server, in order to retrieve different data. So I had at my disposal the server that listed the metadata of all the channels and programs broadcast on the satellite. This data was classified according to the DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) standard, which is widely used in many countries. 

## Reflection

From a purely technical point of view, the experience of this internship has above all allowed me to deepen my knowledge of web development. Indeed, I discovered the very vast world of JavaScript frameworks. I was able to get to know a few of them, before deciding on Svelte, which seemed to me to be the most adapted to the mission I was entrusted with because of its rather light learning curve and the possibility of creating robust and optimised applications.
But the technique is obviously not the only thing I learned during this internship. I was able to discover the functioning, organisation and hierarchy of a large company. The management of such an organisation involves a certain number of challenges, which can become obstacles during the development of a product. Indeed, the development of my applications was not just a hobby for trainees as I had imagined during my first experience at SES. It was in fact a real lever which, if convincing, could trigger the release of a budget for the department, so that these products could one day reach the hands of the end user.
Finally, during my internship, I was able to discover a lot of different profiles, coming from all over the world, whether it was within my own team, or more globally in the company. Indeed, several actions are put in place to integrate newcomers as well as possible, and to allow them to meet the other members of the company around sports tournaments, festive events, or general gatherings. There is a real company culture which is conveyed to us as soon as we arrive, and I think that this is what made my experience at SES so pleasant and so worthwhile.

## Conclusion

This internship has been truly rewarding in many ways. The fact that Jan trusted me completely by letting me manage the project allowed me to really invest myself to the maximum in the mission, and therefore to go very far in my learning of technologies that I had little or no knowledge of at the beginning of my internship. I was also able to discover more deeply the mechanics of the company, including the interdependence of the different departments during the development of a project.
