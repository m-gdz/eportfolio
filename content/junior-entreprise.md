# Junior-Entreprise


As a Business Manager, I have to manage several projects by ensuring the communication between the client and the students of the school who work on the project. 
Furthermore, I ensure the fidelity of the client, and I do prospection to find new ones who can bring new interesting and exciting projects to the Junior- Entreprise.

Here is my 360-Evaluation for S8.
