# Innovation

## Innovation Day

For one day, we were asked to design an innovation project as a team. 

First, we spent the morning looking for ideas, brainstorming, and identifying the needs of society. We then came up with a business project to help other companies in their ecological transition. Indeed, we had the idea of creating "Flowall", which aimed to allow companies to create large plant walls on their buildings, in order to ensure better thermal insulation, and to contribute to the fight against global warming.
Secondly, we sought to obtain figures and statistics in order to make the energy gains concrete, to estimate the costs and to build the business plan. 
Finally, we worked on the communication and in particular the creation of a logo for our company.

It was very interesting to discover the personalities of the team members through collaboration on a common project. It is not easy to agree on a project, but I think we all managed to contribute to the development of this business project. 

Finally, the pitching exercise in front of the whole proma was an enriching exercise, and I was able to discover some very inspiring projects from other teams.
